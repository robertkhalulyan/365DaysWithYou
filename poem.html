            Three hundred and Sixty-Five days, Was the start of a journey,<br>
            A lifetime I could never have envisioned, truly,<br>
            From the moment I shook your hand, <br>
            Introduced myself, and you did the same, <br>
            Our love story began, like sparks to a flame.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            From the first time I took you to the park, our love did ignite,<br>
            To the Halloween party, where our hearts took flight,<br>
            To the beach, we went, sugar fish  by the shore,<br>
            You said, "I really like you," and  my heart soared.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            To Our day at Disney, where magic took flight,<br>
            Under the fireworks, my heart truly knew,<br>
            How much I really did love you.<br>
            Up until the day I asked you to be mine, <br>
            At the place where I should’ve made the first move, under the moon’s shine<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Thinking of our first kiss, a memory so dear,<br>
            In my heart, it's a melody I always want to hear.<br>
            Then I heard your voice, so sweet and true,<br>
            "Robert, I love you," and my heart knew, my love for you was true <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Through obstacles that tried to keep us apart,<br>
            We fought for our love, hand in hand, heart to heart,<br>
            No one's ever made me as happy as you do,<br>
            In your love, my dreams and reality align, it's true.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            From that day one year ago, until now, we've grown,<br>
            In your embrace, I've truly found my home,<br>
            Blessed I am, for this love, a rare find,<br>
            our love’s eternal sign.<br>
            You give me your pinky, I give you mine,<br>
            We lock our fingers and kiss, and that'll last us a lifetime.<br>
            <br>
